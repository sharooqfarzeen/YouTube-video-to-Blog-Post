- **The Nilgiri Hills' Altered Ecology:** The Nilgiri hills, an ancient landscape in India, have undergone significant ecological changes in the last 200 years. The widespread conversion of land into tea plantations has resulted in what environmentalists call "green deserts," negatively impacting the native vegetation.

- **Extensive Tea Plantations and Loss of Biodiversity:** Over 70% of the Nilgiri landscape is now tea plantations, leaving less than 10% of the native ecology intact. This has led to the local extinction of grasslands.

- **Efforts to Restore Native Ecosystems:** Conservation efforts are focused on restoring the montane ecosystems and grasslands. Small grassland patches are being created to form connected corridors, supporting biodiversity and building rich soils.

- **Water Conservation and Climate Change Resilience:** Restoring native plant communities is crucial for water conservation and mitigating the effects of climate change. The region is highly vulnerable to landslides, and these efforts enhance its resilience.

- **Economic Considerations and Alternative Income Sources:** Tea is a major contributor to the Nilgiri economy, with 60-75% of the population depending on it. However, research is underway to find alternative native plants that can provide farmers with comparable or better economic benefits, allowing for rewilding efforts while maintaining livelihoods.
